Poor communicators are dangerous to a company.
Find them early, and train or replace them.

## Warning Signs of Poor Communicators


### Face-to-Face Meetings Without a White Board

If you need to be face-to-face, you should be using a white board.
Face to face basic communication is often a mask for poor communication skills.
Chances are, a lot less was communicated during a meeting than either party thinks.

I used to work in IT support that used a ticketing system.
Some people love ticketing systems, other people hate them.
A ticketing system forces users to articulate and communicate their needs explicitly.
A ticketing system, like email, is a sieve that filters out poor communicators.
The worst offenders could only explain their problems with a series of pointing gestures and beeping noises.


### Giving Orders Instead of Requirements

Good people do not like being told what to do.
Let me correct that,
good people do not appreciate being used.
If you tell a good person what to do,
they will do it exactly.

A poor communicator will often _not know_ how to articulate requirements.
Rather than explaining the problem,
which allows people to be dynamic in their solution,
a poor communicator will usually say _what_ to do.

There are a few problems with this method.
The person explaining what to do often assigns pointless work.
In their inability to explicitly define requirements,
they will take the shotgun approach.
Rather than saying
"clean the underside of the grill, since it accumulates dirty quickly",
they will say "clean the entire stove every day".
To the person who has been assigned the task,
the oven will often look like it is already clean.
A good person will not appreciate being put on pointless tasks,
by putting zero value on their time you are tacitly implying they are of little value.


### Poor Email Usage

Email is a wonderful tool, if used properly.
Poor communicators often avoid email, or respond very sparsely.
It should be normal and expected for email discussions to reach 
a few dozen replies over a week.

Email built the Linux kernel.
If you think your needs are more complicated than that,
feel free to argue your case.

If you find email is not working for your business,
you will get further by either educating or replacing your employees.
A new medium will not solve the problem,
and your business will not magically do better.


### Ad-Hoc Delegation

Poor communicators delegate work rapidly and without structure.
They will mention things in passing, and often in person.
Often the delegatees fail to accomplish tasks because items are forgotten.
It is incorrect to blame the person being assigned work,
this is a clear failure by the person delegating.

If you delegate work, there _must_ be a clear, 
well-known place for people to discover assigned tasks,
at a glance.

Asking someone to do something in person is _not_ an assignment.
At most, you are asking for the feasibility of something.
Sending an email is also not assignment.
Email is the perfect medium for notifying people that new work as been assigned,
however there must always be a central place to check for updates.

An issue tracker, a wiki, a Google Document,
even a white board is an acceptable way to assign tasks.


## Foster Good Communication


### Eliminate Meetings

Meetings are a great way to mask poor communication.
Anything that is forgotten by the end of a meeting did not need to be said.

It is good to bond with your team in person,
but discussing things in a boring meeting is a poor use of time.


### Use Queues

Job queues are another way to filter out poor communication.
A job queue is an indirect way of assigning work,
such that the task description is clearly laid out.
Should the task description be ambiguous,
the person picking up the job should solicit more information from the assigner.


### Know How to Assign Work

Giving orders is appropriate in some circumstances,
but the responsibility of the task must stay with the person assigning the work.
For example, when your business encounters periodic manual tasks,
it can be helpful to just persevere through it with an all-hands approach.
The people being called in do not care about the task,
but good people are usually willing to help.
Give direct, simple instructions that do not require much thinking.
It is inappropriate and lazy to ask people to "use their judgment" for tasks that are not their own.

If you give orders, you must give every step in detail.
Otherwise you are giving a requirement, and must _not_ tell people how to do the task.
Giving requirements transfers responsibility, giving orders does not.
