# Git #

We recommend using Git for all development.
See [Git-Scm](http://git-scm.com/about) for an introduction.

Git lets developers focus on small tasks, rather than the entire project.
Developers should focus on each commit,
in isolation, as an independent, incremental, and atomic update.

## Commits ##

Commits should be atomic.
Each commit should take the code from one working state to another.
There are reasonable exceptions to this,
but incremental working states are a good general measure.

It is quite reasonable to commit ever minute,
but it may also be every half hour.
Experience, practice and peer feedback are the best ways to improve committing behavior.

A commit may touch a single file, or many.
Refactoring a class name might affect most of the source in the repository.
Since every instance of the name must be changed,
it makes sense to include every effected file in the commit.

### Designing Commits ###

Good code starts with good commits.
Git never commits code that you have not explicitly placed into the next commit.
Before code is committed, it must be placed into a staging area called the index.

Not only can individual files be staged, but individual lines in a file.
Use `git add -p` to interactively add chunks of changes.
You can see exactly what has been staged with `git diff --cached`.
Use `git add -i` to fine-tune commits by adding or removing chunks interactively.

Once a commit has been designed,
there will be staged and unstaged code left in the working directory.
It is good practice to test the code with _only_ the staged changes.
Use `git stash --keep-index` to temporarily remove all unstaged changes.
This will leave your working copy exactly as it would appear after the next commit.
After you test and verify the commit, use `git stash pop` to re-apply the unstaged changes.

These commands should be used together to produce better commits,
it might be worth aliasing them.

### Commit Message ###

All commits require messages, and how you write a message is important.

The first line is the commit title:

1. Use Title Case
2. Single Line
3. Use Simple Present Tense
  (i.e. "Fix Type", "Create New Messenger Class")
4. Describe What You Did

If necessary, leave a blank line and write a message explaining _why_ you made the change. 
Write it either as an internal monologue, 
or as a justification to the rest of the team. 
It should contain your reasoning, not the execution. 
The code will self-document what functionality has changed,
commit messages are about explaining why the change was made.
Include references to tickets, communications, and messages that inspired the change.

## Branching ##

Branching is cheap in git, so cheap that _all_ changes should be done on a branch.
You should _never_ work from main â€” Main is for merging!

Create and checkout a new branch with 

    git checkout -b MyNewFeature

Since branching is so easy,
developers are free to explore and share wild ideas without impacting the main code base.
Developers are free to create as many branches as they like;
branches remain local until explicitly pushed.
While it is better to share early, it is not a requirement to share immediately.

## Merging ##

Branches are re-combined in one of two ways:

1. Merge
2. Rebase

Each method combines two branches together, merging code changes along the way.
The difference between each method is how they appear in the commit history.

A rebase produces a sequential history, a merge produces a parallel history.

If your code has not been shared (i.e. `git push`) use rebase.
Rebase looks cleaner, and resolves conflicts better than merge.
If your code has already been shared, you **must** use merge.
Rebasing shared code is the git equivalent of an oil spill,
it is creates a mess that requires a lot of time and effort to clean up.

## Sharing ##

The true power of git comes from sharing.
Developers should push their changes daily.
Do not share everything you do,
it is not necessary to share every experimental branch.
Use lots of branches locally to craft a set of commits worth sharing.

By sharing daily, other developers can give early feedback,
and changes can be merged early.
Merging early creates small frequent conflicts,
rather than a few large conflicts.

If by the end of the day you're not confident about sharing anything,
just pick a branch and push it.
Uncertainty means you need feedback,
the only way to get feedback is to share.
Use a pull request to tell others why you are stuck,
and what that you need feedback.

### Pull Requests ###

Thought not actually a feature of git,
pull requests are an indispensable extension.
A pull request is a web-based forum to discuss a branch of code before it is merged into main.
Github provides an elegant pull request system.
The team can open a pull request as a place to discuss the changes in the branch.
Other developers can comment on the code directly,
or make general comments related to the branch.

Pull requests (PR) form a permanent archive of the intended change,
regardless if the pull request is accepted or denied.
It is okay to open an PR with no intention of ever merging it.
PRs can be used as a place to share experimental code,
or other wild ideas.

Almost all shared branches should have open pull requests attached to them.
Since developers are supposed to push their changes daily,
most PRs should be updated every day.
