## Rules of Engagement ##

Meetings are often the place where people ask and are granted permission to begin new work.
Since there are not meetings, we find another means of scheduling work.

Rules of Engagement (RoE) are a key component to distributed efficiency.
A RoE grants permission to do something automatically.
There is no need to wait for permission, or a meeting.
RoEs are designed to bypass the latency of internal communications and let everyone get working.

The real point that must be emphasized is that one is free to act _without permission_ from the rest of the team.
During development, features and tasks may become blocked, 
but a developer should never be blocked,
they can always switch to an open task.

### Product Owner ###

The product owner may:

1. add, re-order, or remove features to the backlog at any time
2. remove a feature marked Done from the board
3. inspect the in-progress features at any time
4. notify the team master of any problems or concerns

The product owner has no direct control over the development team.

### Developer ###

Any developer may:

1. pull the top **Todo** feature into **In Progress** if there is an available slot
2. open a pull request for any reason
3. provide feedback on another pull request
4. pull more information about a feature from the product owner

### Team Master ###

There are no rules of engagement for the team master. 
All actions taken by the master involve other team members, 
thus there really is no solo action that can be taken.
