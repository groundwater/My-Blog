Traditional offices centralize resources at a specific location. While there 
cost savings and other efficiencies, it does not produce better software faster. 
Great software is created by great developers. Unfortunately, each geographical 
area has a finite supply of highly skilled developers. Therefore, it makes sense
to use better processes to facilitate a distributed team. 

## Overview

We attempt to solve these problems by making use of distributed teams.
We use a pull-oriented model for development where developers pull features from a queue instead of being assigned tasks.
Communication between team members is frequent but asynchronous, utilizing chat rooms and notifications.
Teams are free to work in a style that suits them best;
productivity is measured by working products, not hours spent in an office.

In order to keep individuals working,
we attempt to eliminate as many blocks as possible.

As an individual you are free to start any work you like, you can even finish it.
Start anything you like on your own,
but the team is required to bring that work back into the main project.
