# Rapid Asynchronous Distributed Teams

Traditional offices centralize resources at a specific location. 
While there are cost savings and other efficiencies,
it does not produce better software faster. 
Great software is created by great teams of developers. 
Unfortunately, each geographical area has a finite supply of highly skilled developers.
Therefore, it makes sense to use better processes to facilitate a distributed team. 

Rapid communication is core to a successful RAD Team.
We believe in heathly lifestyles, and a strong community focused culture.
Great people have a need and desire to build and create.


## Overview

We attempt to solve these problems by making use of distributed teams.
We use a pull-oriented model for development where developers pull features from a queue instead of being assigned tasks.
Communication between team members is frequent but asynchronous, utilizing chat rooms and notifications.
Teams are free to work in a style that suits them best;
productivity is measured by working products, not hours spent in an office.
