# Team Guidelines #

Guidelines are different from rules of engagement. 
A RoE specifies behavior the team may engage in without pre-approval.
Guidelines require communication and coordination between team members.
Think of guidelines as recommended behavior for teams.

Code that has been pushed belongs to the team.
Get used to other people changing your code,
or just to realize that it's not your code anymore.

## Roles ##

### Developers ###

A developer is free to work wherever, however, and whenever they like. 
Their only responsibility is to support the team. 
The team as a whole is responsible for moving features through the pipeline.

In order to support the team, developers must communication. 
The asynchronous chat system is notification driven. 
Any time a developer is stuck, bored, blocked, or confused, they should notify their team. 
If possible mention key people in the notification with @mentions.

The duty of a developer is the keep his or her team updated.

Use pull-requests for any and all work. Work in progress is judged by how often code is pushed. 
If a developer has not pushed code in 3 days, 
from the teams perspective they have not done any work in the last 3 days.
Aside from vacation or sick days, this should not occur.
It doesn't matter how much code is being pushed, one line can be as good as one thousand.

Working code is the ultimate measure of success, 
and working code means passing tests.


### Master ###

The masters job is to give feedback to the entire team. 
Thus all work done by the master involves directly communicating with team members. 
The master should **trust but verify** as many parts of the project as possible.

1. has code been reviewed before merging
2. are developers pushing their changes often enough
3. are features in the pipeline bottlenecking or backing up
4. has the product owner submitted a proper feature request

The master should keep the wheels greased and find and optimize hot-spots.


### Product Owner ###

Despite the owner bearing sole responsibility for feature decisions, 
they are allowed and encouraged to seek team feedback while writing user stories and feature requests.

## Github Etiquette ##

Pushed code belongs to the team,
but even still developers need their own domains of control.
If you did not open the pull request,
it is good manners to discuss your intentions before pushing an update to that branch.
If you wish to significantly alter the code in the branch,
create a new branch with a new PR.
Any developer can branch another developer's work in progress,
pushed code belongs to the team.
If you do branch a branch,
leave a notice in the original PR.

Your pushed code belongs to the team!
Other developers can and will offer their wild opinions on your code.
Treat all objections as "please explain your rationale".
We encourage open debates as long as, at the end of the day, new changes have been pushed.
Developers must reach a level of mutual trust and respect in order for this to work well.

## Email Etiquette ##

### Use Quotes

Email is a sequential discussion, and rarely do lengthly email discussions fit nicely into this model.
Always, always, always use quotes when replying.
A reader should _not_ have to read previous emails to understand the context of your reply.
If it a waste of your time to find the right quote,
it is a waste of _our_ time to read the reply.

### Respond Quickly

Replying slowly is unacceptable.
If you cannot answer a question within a few hours,
you should reply saying how long you expect the answer to take.

### Issue Tracking

Issues that will take a great deal of time should be migrated to a proper issue tracker.
Your inbox is not your organizer.
If we delete your entire inbox today,
you should not lose more than a few days worth of information.
