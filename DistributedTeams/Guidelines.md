## Team Guidelines ##

Guidelines are different from rules of engagement. 
A RoE specifies behaviour the team may engage in without pre-approval.
Guidelines require communication and coordination between team members.
Think of guidelines as recommended behaviour for teams.

### Developers ###

A developer is free to work wherever, however, and whenever they like. 
Their only responsibility is to support the team. 
The team as a whole is responsible for moving features through the pipeline.

In order to support the team, developers must communication. 
The asynchronous chat system is notification driven. 
Any time a developer is stuck, bored, blocked, or confused, they should notify their team. 
If possible mention key people in the notification with @mentions.

The duty of a developer is the keep his or her team updated.

Use pull-requests for any and all work. Work in progress is judged by how often code is pushed. 
If a developer has not pushed code in 3 days, 
from the teams perspective they have not done any work in the last 3 days.
Aside from vacation or sick days, this should not occur.
It doesn't matter how much code is being pushed, one line can be as good as one thousand.

Working code is the ultimate measure of success, 
and working code means passing tests.

### Master ###

The masters job is to give feedback to the entire team. 
Thus all work done by the master involves directly communicating with team members. 
The master should **trust but verify** as many parts of the project as possible.

1. has code been reviewed before merging
2. are developers pushing their changes often enough
3. are features in the pipeline bottlenecking or backing up
4. has the product owner submitted a proper feature request

The master should keep the wheels greased and find and optimize hot-spots.

### Product Owner ###

Despite the owner bearing sole responsibility for feature decisions, 
they are allowed and encouraged to seek team feedback while writing user stories and feature requests.
