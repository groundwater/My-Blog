# Communication

The heart of our process lies in communication.
Teams are free to setup and manage their own work processes,
the only requirement is that they communicate on shared channels as much as possible.

## Group Messaging

Using the group messaging is _very_ important.
If you are not messaging,
you are shutting out the rest of the team.

Think of the group chat rooms more like a notifications board than a live chat room.
As it is a notifications board, use it frequently.
The more frequent the better.

Send notifications when you:

- are starting a new task
- switch tasks
- are blocked by another developer
- need a break
- are starting a work session
- are finished a work session


## Pull Requests

Share your thoughts on how to solve problems.
The best place for this is a pull request (PR).
A PR needs a branch with a single commit to be opened;
it is not only acceptable but encouraged to open PRs after a single commit.
Discussing intention is important, before and during your work.
