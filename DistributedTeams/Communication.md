# Communication

## Group Messaging

Using the group messaging is _very_ important.
If you are not messaging,
you are shutting out the rest of the team.

Think of the group chat rooms more like a notifications board than a live chat room.
As it is a notifications board, use it frequently.
The more frequent the better.

Send notifications when you:

- are starting a new task
- switch tasks
- are blocked by another developer
- need a break
- are starting a work session
- are finished a work session


## Pull Requests

Share your thoughts on how to solve problems.
The best place for this is a pull request (PR).
A PR needs a branch with a single commit to be opened;
it is not only acceptable but encouraged to open PRs after a single commit.
Discussing intention is important, before and during your work.
