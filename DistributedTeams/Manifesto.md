## First Class Teams

This is the most important part, 
if you do not have a first class team, 
implementing the remaining pieces will not help.

A first class team is difficult to define,
but generally means the following things hold true:

1. the team shares a common vision, and set of core values
2. team members are driven by a passion
3. there exists a mutual respect between members

## Collaborate Asynchronously

A first class team member can work whenever and wherever they want.
Use web-based tools to maintain conversation threads;
team members work while productive, and collaborate during breaks.

Team members should deal with the largest task standing between them and their largest goal with complete dedication. By working asynchronously, team members can optimize their productivity.

## Communicate Continuously

Despite being distributed and asynchronous,
a team should communicate constantly and continuously.
Every waking through needs a plate that it can be shared with the rest of the team.
Share both work and non-work thoughts;
teams need to bond socially as well as professionally.

## Push Contributions Daily

Progress is measured by shared working code.
There is no reason every team member cannot push real changes every day they work.
This does not mean push to production, or even deployment.
If the team cannot see the work, it does not exist.

Pushing work is a boolean measurement, either members pushed or they did not push.
Judging progress beyond that is meaningless and a waste of time.
Do not use lines of code, do not use tests passed, do not use sub-measurements.
If a team member does not write code, there must be other visible changes they can make,
such as reviewing code, or writing documentation.

## Use Rules of Engagement

Team members should _always_ have something they can work on.
A team is not an orchestra, their motions are not synchronized nor directed by a conductor.
Each team member works according to rules of engagement that define what they can do without needing to ask.
The more things teams can do without prior approval, the fewer stalls the team will encounter.
