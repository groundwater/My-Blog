I am trying something, my blog is open source.
I would like to not only share the process of creating an article,
but want people to contribute and improve upon what I have done.

My blog is written in Markdown and hosted on Github,
you can pre-read anything I'm working on there.
You can open a pull-request or post issues if you wish to contribute.
I would welcome it, and give you due credit.

I try to record my thoughts in each git commit,
justifying why I changed each piece.
If you do contribute, I would encourage you to do the same.
