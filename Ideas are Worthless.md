# Stop Asking Me for an Idea

You know something, ideas are worthless.
Facebook was not an original idea, Google was not an original idea,
and the iPhone was not an original idea.
If you go around holding and trading ideas like they are stocks,
you are playing the wrong game entirely;
you are holding Monopoly money.

Before I go further I feel obligated, as a student of rigor,
to define what I mean by an idea.

> An idea is a mostly formed vision of a product, aimed at solving a well-defined problem.

There is no billion dollar idea, there is only billion dollar execution.


## Ideas are a Poor Foundation

It is a mistake to lead your business with an idea.
There is really only one reason why it is a mistake, ideas change.

1. Founding your business around an idea means the reason you formed your business will soon be non-existent.

2. If you connect with people via your idea,
you may lose that connection when the idea changes.

3. If you found your business on an idea, you will become too attached to it.

Introducing strong ideas too early can almost guarantee failure.


## Real Foundations

Values, values, values.
You _must_ have clear values.
Why do you want a business, and what is your companies larger purpose?

Rather than provide a strict definition, I will give an example from Google.

> Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful

There is nothing related to a particular product or idea in the above.

Values never change, or rarely so.
Your team must share the company values,
so much so that this should be the primary discussion when hiring.

Once you find a team who shares values,
you can build your team and foster a shared vision.
As a founder, you are there to build your team, and indirectly your company.
A strong team will eat through ideas quickly,
able to execute them with a high quality and efficiency.


## Conclusions

Ideas are the fuel of any company, just not the engine.
Any good team needs ideas, but ideas are small and digestible.
There is no fundamental idea, core to the company.
A good team should not discuss ideas, but act on them.
Debating the validity of an ideas is voodoo science,
you are debating things based entirely on unproven precepts and made up data.

The more a company holds onto and debates an idea, the slower your engine turns.
The slower your engine turns, the slower your company moves.

So please stop asking me about my idea.
Do not lecture me that "every good business needs an idea".
Every car needs petrol,
but the creators of the Bugatti Veyron did not start building the fastest road car
by searching for the worlds best fuel.
